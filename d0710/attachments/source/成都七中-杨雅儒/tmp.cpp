//4.Let's assume that the earth is a homogeneous sphere and the radius of the earth is R. An object free fall from a height of R(that means it is 2R distance from the center of the earth). Calculate the speed of the object when it reaches the ground. Acceleration of gravity g=9.7803185m/s^2,The radius of the earth R=6378137m.
